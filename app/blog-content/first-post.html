This tutorial walks you through creating your first packaged app. Packaged apps are structured similarly to extensions so current developers will recognize the manifest and packaging methods. When you're done, you'll just need to produce a zip file of your code and assets in order to publish your app.

A packaged app contains these components:

The manifest tells Chrome about your app, what it is, how to launch it and the extra permissions that it requires.
The background script is used to create the event page responsible for managing the app life cycle.
All code must be included in the package. This includes HTML, JS, CSS and Native Client modules.
All icons and other assets must be included in the package as well.
